## Who This Is For

You already use AI agents and existing skills. Now you want to create your own — whether that's a skill for your specific domain, a meta-skill that routes to multiple sub-skills, or a full pipeline that chains skills together in dependency order.

No traditional programming background required. If you can write markdown and think in systems, you can build skills.
